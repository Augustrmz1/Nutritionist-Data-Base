# Client Database System for Nutritionist

## Project Description

This project aims to create a client database system for a nutritionist. The system will manage a database of 20 patients classified into the following categories: athletes, adults, children, and overweight patients. Each category will have specific methods tailored for more personalized consultations. A superclass, Patient, will contain general methods that will serve as the base for all subclasses through inheritance and polymorphism. This tool will help the nutritionist maintain a detailed and organized record of their patients, facilitating the tracking of progress and decision-making based on data.

## Features

- **Patient Classification:** Patients are categorized into four groups:
  - Athletes
  - Oncologic
  - Children
  - Overweight Patients
- **Super and abstract Patient class:** Contains general methods applicable to all patient types, ensuring consistency and reuse through inheritance.
- **Specialized Methods:** Each patient category will have specific methods for personalized consultations.
- **Patient Registration:** Allows registration of new patients with the following data:
  - Name
  - Age
  - Gender
  - Weight
  - Height
- **Data Update:** Ability to update existing patient information.
- **Information Retrieval:** Detailed retrieval of each patient's information.
- **Intuitive Visualization:** Clear and accessible organization and visualization of data.

## System Requirements

- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Libraries and Dependencies:** string and cmath

## Why This Project Is Interesting

**Addressing a Real-World Need:**
In the field of nutrition and healthcare, there is a critical need for efficient data management systems. Many nutritionists still rely on manual or outdated methods for keeping track of patient information, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. This project addresses this gap by offering a modern, digital solution that streamlines the process, reducing errors and saving valuable time.

**Technical Challenge:**
Creating a comprehensive client database system involves several interesting technical challenges. These include designing robust data structures, ensuring data security and integrity, and developing a user-friendly interface. Tackling these challenges will not only enhance your skills as a developer but also result in a highly functional and valuable product.

**Scalability and Flexibility:**
Designing a system that can scale with a growing number of patients and adapt to different types of data is a compelling challenge. Ensuring that the database can handle increasing amounts of data without sacrificing performance or usability is critical. This project allows you to explore solutions for scalability and flexibility, essential skills in the tech industry.

**User-Centric Design:**
Creating a system that is intuitive and easy to use is crucial, especially in a professional setting where users may not have extensive technical expertise. By focusing on user experience (UX) design, the project can develop a product that meets the practical needs of nutritionists, making their workflow more efficient and less stressful. This emphasis on UX can differentiate this project from other technical solutions.

**Potential for Expansion:**
The initial scope of the project includes basic patient data management, but there is significant potential for future expansion.

**Positive Social Impact:**
By providing a tool that helps nutritionists offer better care, this project has the potential to positively impact the broader community. Improved health tracking and management can lead to better overall health outcomes, contributing to the well-being of individuals and communities. This social impact adds an extra layer of significance to the project.
